TEMPLATE FOR NAMELIST
=====================

Overview
--------

Figures from Wenzel et al. (2014) are reproduced with namelist_wenz14jgr.xml. Variables relevant for the carbon cycle-climate feedback such as near surface air temperature (tas), net biosphere productivity (nbp) and (fgco2) are analyzed for coupled (1pctCO2; here the carbon cycle is fully coupled to the climate response) and uncoupled (esmFixCLim1; here the carbon cycle is uncoupled to the climate response) simulations. The standard namelist includes a comparison of cumulated nbp from coupled and uncoupled simulations and includes a set of routines to diagnose the long-term carbon cycle-climate feedback parameter (GammaLT) from an ensemble of CMIP5 models. Also included in the namelist is a comparison of the interannual variability of nbp and fgco2 for historical simulations used to diagnose the observable sensitivity of CO2 to tropical temperature changes (GammaIAV). As a key figure of this namelist, the diagnosed values from the models GammaLT vs. GammaIAV are compared in a scatter plot constituting an emergent constraint.


Available Namelists and Diagnostics
-----------------------------------

Namelists are stored in nml/

* namelist_wenzel14jgr.xml

Diagnostics are stored in diag_scripts/

* tsline.ncl: time line plots of annual means for spatial averages
* carbon_corr_2var.ncl: scatter plot of annual mean anomalies of two different variables; diagnosing and saving GammaIAV
* carbon_constraint.ncl: scatter plot of GammaLT vs. GammaIAV + line plot of probability density functions; diagnosing GammaLT



User settings
-------------
