        # Whitespace is removed by docstring parser, see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/

        D210, # No whitespaces allowed surrounding docstring text
        # For short descriptions it makes sense not to end with a period:
        D400, # First line should end with a period
        # Disable because not part of PEP257 official convention:
        D203, # 1 blank line required before class docstring
        D212, # Multi-line docstring summary should start at the first line
        D213, # Multi-line docstring summary should start at the second line
        D404, # First word of the docstring should not be This
