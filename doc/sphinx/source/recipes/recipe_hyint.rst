Hydroclimatic intensity and extremes (HyInt)
==============================================
 

Overview
--------
This module computes a set of 6 indices that allow to evaluate the response of the hydrological cycle to global warming with a joint view of both wet and dry extremes. The indices were selected following Giorgi et al. (2014): the simple precipitation intensity index (SDII), the maximum dry spell length (DSL) and wet spell length (WSL), the hydroclimatic intensity index (HY-INT), a measure of the overall behaviour of the hydroclimatic cycle (Giorgi et al., 2011), and the precipitation area (PA), i.e. the area over which at any given day precipitation occurs, (Giorgi et al., 2014). Additionally also a selection of the 27 ETCCDI indices produced by the extremeEvents recipe can be ingested to produce timeseries plots (calling the extremeEvents diagnostics). Trends are calculated using the R `lm` function and significance testing performed with a Student T test on non-null coefficients hypothesis. Trend coefficients are stored together with their statistics which include standard error, t value and Pr(>|t|). The tool produces a variety of types of plots including timeseries with their spread, trend lines and summary plots of trend coefficients.

The hydroclimatic indices calculated by the diagnostic and included in the output are defined as follows:

* PRY = mean annual precipitation

* INT = mean annual precipitation intensity (intensity during wet days, or simple precipitation intensity index SDII)

* WSL = mean annual wet spell length (number of consecutive days during each wet spell)

* DSL = mean annual dry spell lenght (number of consecutive days during each dry spell)

* PA  = precipitation area (area over which of any given day precipitation occurs)

* R95 = heavy precipitation index (percent of total precipitation above the 95% percentile of the reference distribution)

* HY-INT = hydroclimatic intensity. HY-INT = normalized(INT) x normalized(DSL).
