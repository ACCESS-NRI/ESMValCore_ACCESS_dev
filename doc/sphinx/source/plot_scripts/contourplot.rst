   Description
      Wrapper for gsn_csm_contour 
      (http://www.ncl.ucar.edu/Document/Graphics/Interfaces/gsn_csm_contour.shtml)
      Opens default wks, if not provided as argument of type "graphic".
      Defines default resources, which are overridden by argument res.
      Creates plot, according to wks & res.
  
   Caveats
      Selection of defaults for res almost arbitrary.
      Please check results of all scripts that use this routine if modifying
      the defaults!
      Input via netCDF not yet implemented.
