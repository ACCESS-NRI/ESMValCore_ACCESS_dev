This file is part of AutoAssess.

This directory contains all the moose query files for all assessment areas
of AutoAssess. Each file contains the query to retrieve all data from a Unified
Model output stream.
Per area, the number of query files represent the minimum number of MOOSE 
queries to retrieve all necessary data for the area, as MOOSE select queries
apply only to a single UM output stream.


Query file naming convention:
-----------------------------

[Area Name].[Averaging Period].[UM stream letter].txt


Area Name: 
Name of the assessment area in lowercase letters (monsoon, stratosphere, etc.).


Averaging Period: 
Give the period over which the data is average. Must be one of [annual, 
seasonal, monthly, daily].
The averaging period is used to name the destination directory, it not required
for retrieval.


UM stream letter: 
A lowercase letter indicated from which PP file the data has to be retrieved.  

The command 'moo ls URI' shows the available PP files, each represents the data
from a UM output stream. The last letter in the filename is what has to 
specified in the query file's filename.
