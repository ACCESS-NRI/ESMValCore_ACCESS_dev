ESMValTool v2.0.0
=================

Basic analysis structure (current: 16 August 2017)
==================================================

User runs python main.py nml/namelist_whatever.yml

* main.py calls yaml_parser to parse the namelist; also initiates project_info dictionary;
* main.py -> preprocess.py
* preprocess.py finds data files (if multiple data files per model call to preprocessing_tools.py to iris concatenate them)
* preprocess.py establishes environment variables (model, project, variable etc)
* preprocess.py calls reformat.ncl
* preprocess.py calls derive_var.ncl
* preprocess.py does regridding (via regrid.py) if wanted
* main.py calls diagnostic script

Major benefit of current code structure: everything dealing with preprocessing can be done externally of diagnostic 
script (via preprocess.py and associated libraries) OR via diagnostic script; preprocess.py will be strong enough to act as
a diagnostic on its own.

Code changed compared to previous release
=========================================

Current /interface_scripts

* auxiliary.ncl - unchanged
* auxiliary.py - minor changes to screen output
* constants.ncl - unchanged
* data_handling.ncl - unchanged
* data_interface.py - major changes (complete restructuring to allow yaml parser to work)
* derive_var.ncl - unchanged
* fx_file.py - unchanged (but probably will be purged)
* launchers.py - single change to the ncl style file location
* messaging.ncl - unchanged
* preprocessing_tools.py - NEW: contains a lot of preprocessing functions (masking, globbing, time-area operations)
* preprocess.py - NEW: contains basic tools (get file paths etc) and preprocess steps (call to cmor reformat, masking, regridding)
* regrid.py - NEW: contains regridding and level selection functions (Bill Little)
* write_header.ncl - unchanged
* write_references.ncl - unchanged
* yaml_parser.py - NEW: yaml parser functional

In current directory:

* main.py - major changes and simplifications (wrapper that calls all the under the hood functionalities)
